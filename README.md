minimal-test
============

Minimal program to read a `.tflite` model and do inferences.

1. Link of the original [minimal program from Tensorflow repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.12/tensorflow/contrib/lite/examples/minimal/minimal.cc). 
2. Original [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/examples/minimal/CMakeLists.txt) file from Tensorflow repo.
3. Regarding to source [2], our own [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/aniladar/minimal-test/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt) is generated by simplifying the original one and adding full 
path of flatbuffers.h to `target_include_directories` & adding _pthread_ to `target_link_libraries`.
